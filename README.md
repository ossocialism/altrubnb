# AltruBnB

### An Open Source Socialism Foundation Project

## **🎯 What**

> A community-owned, open-source platform for short-term rentals — a public-interest alternative to Airbnb.
> 

Its purpose is to:

- support fair hosting and booking
- align with local housing policy
- reduce extractive platform fees
- give cities real governance capacity
- reinvest value into communities rather than shareholders

This is not about cloning a startup, it’s about **public digital infrastructure.**

## 🤔 **Why AltruBnB ?**

We are living in a time of a widening gap between the **haves and the have-nots.**

Housing, social mobility, and opportunity feel increasingly unevenly distributed. At the same time, the tension between **“left” and “right”** is escalating to the point where collaboration often feels impossible.

But societies don’t move forward by winning arguments — they move forward by **building things together**.

We need projects that:

- people from both sides of the political spectrum can support
- create tangible public value
- are difficult to block simply through power or veto

Open, public digital infrastructure is one of those rare spaces.

It does not require everyone to agree on everything — only to agree that **people deserve tools that work for them,** where “socialists” have a good chance to compete with “capitalists”.

Airbnb and similar techno-lords (see [**Technofeudalism**](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technofeudalism)) innovated by doing something genuinely new at the time:

They built large scale SaaS (Software as a service) platforms, solving the engineering challenges of the time to successfully **coordinate millions of decentralized service providers and and customers via a single centralized marketplace**.

But today, the SaaS software architecture “moat” is gone.

- building SaaS platforms is no longer an engineering miracle
- modern tooling and AI make platform development widely accessible
- open-source products have a proven track record (The best example ironically, is Kubernetes, a software infrastructure technology that allows corporations to run large scale SaaS platforms optimally).

There is no good reason municipalities and governments cannot compete when:

- the platform is open source and developed by a large community
- SaaS Infrastructure and Architecture is de facto standardized

Open source means:

- municipalities from all over world can collaborate
- municipalities don’t beg platforms for data — they own the system
- each municipality is free to run the service on their own terms so
    - communities can shape rules that fit local housing realities
    - the economic value created locally **stays local**

This is the same pattern that played out with Kubernetes:

- multiple interested parties shared a common problem
- open source infrastructure beat proprietary silos
- collaboration replaced dependence on a single vendor

Housing platforms are ready for the same transformation.

### That’s how the cookie crumbles

Entrepreneurs and innovators break new ground, reap the early rewards of their ideas, and for a brief moment enjoy the unique fruits of being first. Success attracts gravity: competitors study, imitate, refine, and eventually commoditize what was once daring and new. The time to commoditize Short-term rental platforms has come. 

The same way Nespresso turned capsule coffee into a premium experience and later saw supermarket shelves fill with near-identical pods. In every cycle the pattern repeats: invention, harvest, imitation, diffusion.

## **🛠️ How**

We will:

- build the platform openly as an open-source project
- welcome contributors across skill levels
- collaborate with municipalities interested in public alternatives
- involve universities so contributions count academically
- allow multiple cities to co-create features instead of duplicating effort

Because it is open source:

- no single corporation controls direction
- cities can contribute instead of compete against each other
- inexperienced developers can gain real-world experience
- the platform evolves based on shared needs

And because the value is public:

- governance remains transparent
- incentives stay aligned with communities
- the project can outlast any single funder or administration

## **📚 Local Community, Talent & Municipal Opportunity**

AltruBnB is not only a platform — it is an **opportunity for cities**.

Municipalities such as **Lisbon, Portugal** can use projects like this to:

- develop **local technical talent**
- create high-value employment pathways
- strengthen the local innovation economy
- reduce dependence on foreign platforms and vendors

Instead of watching value flow outward to global platforms, cities can **invest in their own people**.

By contributing to AltruBnB, local residents:

- learn directly from **experienced volunteers and mentors**
- gain **real, proven industry experience** working on a live product
- build public portfolios that employers recognize
- participate in open collaboration instead of unpaid “platform dependence”

This is not theoretical training — it is **hands-on city-building**.

Municipal support can include:

- funding community contributors
- sponsoring civic-tech fellowships and apprenticeships
- creating **co-working spaces and innovation centers** where residents learn and collaborate
- providing grants to community developers and maintainers

This allows cities like Lisbon to:

- retain talent instead of exporting it
- grow local entrepreneurship ecosystems
- keep economic value circulating locally
- build technological self-reliance

> Funded by the people, built by the people, for the people

## **🎓 Universities as Partners in Public Digital Infrastructure**

Universities can play a central role in this movement. Around the world, **millions of software developers already contribute to open-source projects to gain professional recognition, build portfolios, and signal capability**. Universities are uniquely positioned between public institutions, local communities, and the next generation of builders — and can help channel that same energy toward public-interest digital infrastructure.

They are uniquely positioned between:

- public institutions
- local communities
- the next generation of builders

By engaging with AltruBnB, universities can:

- integrate **real public-interest software projects** into their curriculum
- offer students meaningful alternatives to speculative startup culture
- directly support municipalities such as Lisbon in developing local talent
- participate in shaping the **future of civic digital infrastructure**

Students who contribute:

- work on a real, running platform
- collaborate with experienced engineers, architects, and product leaders
- gain **industry-recognized practical experience**
- build public portfolios rather than closed corporate work
- see the social impact of their code in their own cities

Universities benefit as well:

- stronger ties with municipalities and regional government
- enhanced reputation in open-source and public-interest technology
- research opportunities in housing policy, governance, economics, and digital infrastructure
- improved graduate employability through hands-on project work

Universities can support in many ways, including:

- recognizing contributions as **academic credit or coursework**
- sponsoring research groups and civic-tech labs
- hosting **innovation centers, hackathons, and co-working spaces**
- embedding students directly into municipal digital projects

## **🔓 Why Open Source**

Open source ensures that the digital infrastructure managing housing is **not owned by a single corporation**. It allows cities, universities, and citizens to inspect, improve, and operate the platform themselves instead of relying on a black-box service.

It also unlocks the strength of the global open-source community:

- anyone can contribute — from someone learning to code to a senior engineer
- contributors can join from anywhere in the world
- people contribute because it matters socially, not just commercially

### **📉 Decommodification**

Open source shifts the platform from:

- a private product that extracts fees

to:

- shared infrastructure anyone can run and improve

The value is created in:

- local services
- local communities
- local innovation

— not in platform rent-seeking.

### **🪟 Transparency**

With open source:

- policies are visible
- algorithms are auditable
- decision rules can be reviewed and debated

No hidden scoring systems.

No undisclosed prioritization.

No “trust us.”

Trust comes from **inspectable code and open governance.**

### **🕸️ Decentralization**

Decentralization ensures:

- each municipality can run its own platform instance
- local rules stay local
- there is no single point of control or failure

### **🔒 Privacy by design**

User data does **not** flow through a global corporate hub.

Instead:

- regulators receive only the data meant for them
- municipalities keep their own sensitive records
- hosts and guests avoid unnecessary data collection

Decentralization aligns with:

- privacy
- local autonomy
- democratic control
